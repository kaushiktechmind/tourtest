        "Andamans are one of the dream destinations for most of the Indians. Enchanting beaches feels like a paradise. Mesmerising sights of Sunsets and sunrise.The ferry rides between the islands gives you the same thrills as that of a roller coaster. Overall, our experience of Andamans visit was charming and lovely"

        "If you're planning your next vacation to Andaman, if you're new here, and don't know where to go, how to commute, where to eat, just stop your chaotic thoughts over there. Book your affordable Andaman Islands package (Port Blair, Havelock, and more) with Andaman Mangroves and just enjoy the vacation you were waiting for from a long time. They will do all the major planning for you.We did a 1N Port Blair+3N Havelock+ 2N Port Blair trip, and it was a memorable experience. Didn't have to worry about the logistics, the tickets, and more. The team was very prompt, polite, and helpful throughout our stay.",
